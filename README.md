## XPDive
A small tool for Windows (focused for Windows XP) to enable/disable Windows features (by modifying registry). 

- ℹ️ Can be use to enable or disabled program or registry and different functionalities.

## Info
I got the idea from [here](https://github.com/DS1NC-DesConnet/VMAntiKill). Kind of inspiration but this one reasonably targets Windows XP.

## Compiling
I've used Lazarus Pascal IDE to build and compile the whole source. Only IDEs like lazarus or based on lazarus are supported for compilation. Click any of those files (forms, units) to load everything with the IDE. Then go above and click on Run > Compile or issue Shift + F9 to build the program.

## Screenshot
Click on those check bars to enable/disable a certain program or the functionality.
